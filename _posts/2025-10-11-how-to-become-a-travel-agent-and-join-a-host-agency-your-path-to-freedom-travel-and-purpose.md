      ### **2. Complete the Onboarding & Training**


      Once you join, you’ll go through training to learn about travel booking systems, marketing, and supplier programs. You’ll get your login credentials and learn how to make your first bookings.


      ### **3. Start Sharing Your Passion**


      Leverage social media, conversations, and referrals. Share your experiences, family trips, and travel tips. People love booking with agents they *know and trust*.


      ### **4. Build Relationships & Grow**


      The more you book, the more you learn. Many travel agents start part-time, then go full-time once they see the income potential.


      Some also choose to mentor others, helping new agents start their own businesses under the same host — creating a stream of **residual income** in the process.


      ## **Who Is This Opportunity For?**


      * **Moms or parents** who want flexibility


      * **Travel lovers** who enjoy helping others


      * **Entrepreneurs** looking for low-cost business options


      * **Retirees or part-timers** wanting extra income


      * **Anyone craving freedom and purpose**



      Becoming a travel agent is more than a business — it’s a lifestyle. It’s about freedom, connection, and helping others explore the world while creating the life you deserve.


      If you’ve ever said to yourself, *“I wish I could do something I love…”*, this is your sign.


      Watch the video above to see how simple it can be — and if you feel that spark, reach out and let’s chat. I’d love to help you start your own journey. Schedule a meeting [here!](https://calendly.com/voyagebyluna)

That dream is absolutely possible when you become a **home-based travel agent** and partner with a **trusted host agency**.

Whether you’re a mom looking for flexibility, someone craving financial freedom, or just a passionate traveler who loves helping others, this article will walk you through how it works — and why joining a host agency might be the smartest way to start.

## **What Is a Host Travel Agency?**

A **host agency** is an established travel company that allows independent agents (like you!) to run your own travel business under their license, tools, and supplier connections.

Think of it as joining a “team” that gives you access to:

* **Accredited travel licenses** (IATA, CLIA, etc.)

* **Top supplier partnerships** (cruise lines, resorts, airlines, tours)

* **Training and mentorship**

* **Booking platforms & technology**

* **Commission payouts** — without needing to become a large agency yourself

It’s the perfect setup if you want to start quickly, legally, and professionally — without the overwhelm of building from scratch.

## **Why Join a Host Agency Instead of Going Solo?**

When you go solo, you’d need to:

* Apply for your own travel accreditation (which can cost thousands)

* Build relationships with hundreds of travel suppliers

* Handle all back-office systems, invoicing, and training on your own
* Lower commission payout by suppliers


By joining a **host agency**, all that is already done for you. You get to focus on what truly matters — **creating unforgettable experiences for your clients** and building your income.

### **Key Benefits:**

 ✅ **Low start-up cost** compared to opening your own agency
 ✅ **Instant access** to preferred travel suppliers and better commissions
 ✅ **Mentorship & community support**
 ✅ **Flexible schedule** — work from home, part-time or full-time
 ✅ **Travel perks** and industry discounts
 ✅ **Scalable business model** — grow your team, earn residual income

## **What Does a Travel Agent Actually Do?**

As a travel agent, you’ll help clients plan, book, and experience their dream vacations — from cruises and resorts to destination weddings and group trips.

Your role includes:

* Listening to clients’ preferences and budgets

* Recommending destinations, itineraries, and deals

* Booking flights, hotels, cruises, and activities

* Providing insider tips, travel insurance, and 24/7 support


And the best part? You earn a **commission** from the travel suppliers, not from your clients. That means you can offer incredible value *and* make money doing it.

## **How to Get Started Step-by-Step**

### **1. Choose the Right Host Agency**

Do some research. Look for one that’s **licensed, reputable**, and offers **training + mentorship**.
If you’re new to the industry, a company like **Evolution Travel (powered by Archer Travel)** is a great option — they’ve been in business for over 72 years and support new agents every step of the way.
