Budai, often mistaken for the Buddha himself, is a figure rooted in Chinese folklore and Zen Buddhism. Known as the “Laughing Monk,” his cheerful smile and round belly symbolize happiness and abundance.  

You’ll often find Budai statues in temples, markets, and homes across Asia. His story reminds us to live with gratitude and to spread joy wherever we go.  

For travelers in China, visiting a temple with a Budai statue is not just about sightseeing, but about connecting with centuries of tradition.
