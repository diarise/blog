      The wait is over — Universal Orlando Resort’s highly anticipated fourth
      theme park, Universal Epic Universe, is officially open. Guests can now
      step into five extraordinary themed worlds, each designed to redefine what
      a theme-park vacation can be.


      With more than 50 immersive rides, shows, dining spots, and shops, Epic Universe sets a new standard for entertainment and innovation. Whether you’re exploring Celestial Park, venturing into the Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic, playing in SUPER NINTENDO WORLD, discovering How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk, or diving into Dark Universe, the adventure is real, and the portals are open.


      ### **Five Worlds. Endless Adventure.**


      Universal Epic Universe will transport guests into five distinct realms, each packed with groundbreaking attractions and imaginative experiences:


      1. **Celestial Park** – A lush, open hub connecting all worlds. Expect fountains, gardens, and family-friendly attractions that blend nature and technology.


      2. **The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Ministry of Magic** – A new chapter in the beloved Harry Potter saga, where guests can explore both 1920s Paris and the British Ministry of Magic.


      3. **SUPER NINTENDO WORLD™** – Step into your favorite Nintendo games, complete with interactive rides and adventures alongside Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach.


      4. **How to Train Your Dragon – Isle of Berk** – A breathtaking land inspired by DreamWorks’ hit film, filled with dragons, Viking villages, and family-friendly fun.
