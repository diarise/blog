Starting a travel business from home is one of the most flexible and rewarding opportunities available today. Whether you want a side hustle or a full-time career, the travel industry in the US offers countless ways to earn income while helping others create unforgettable experiences.

This guide will walk you through exactly how to get started, what to expect, and why partnering with a reputable host agency like Archer Travel is the smartest way to build your business.

### **What Does a Home-Based Travel Agent Do?**

Home-based travel agents help individuals, families, and groups plan and book trips. This includes flights, hotels, cruises, tours, activities, destination weddings, group travel, and more.

The real value comes from your knowledge and personal service. While anyone can book online, many travelers prefer to work with someone who understands destinations, can recommend the best options, and provides support from start to finish.

Agents also gain access to exclusive rates, travel perks, and commissions from their travel partners. You can work part-time, full-time, or scale your business over time.

### **Step 1: Understand the Industry and Choose Your Path**

There are two main ways to become a travel agent in the US:

1. **Start your own agency independently.** This requires business registration, licensing, IATA or CLIA numbers, and establishing relationships with vendors.
2. **Partner with a host agency.** This is the most common and beginner-friendly route. A host agency provides their accreditations, booking systems, training, and vendor access so you can focus on learning and growing your business.

Starting with a host agency is often faster and more cost-effective, allowing you to plug into a system that’s already built.

### **Step 2: Partner with a Reputable Host Agency**

While you don’t need a travel degree, you do need the right structure and support. Partnering with a trusted host agency gives you everything you need to operate legally and professionally.

Archer Travel, the host agency I work with, has been in business for over 75 years. They provide full licensing, industry credentials, access to top vendors, and comprehensive training. This allows new agents to get started with confidence and begin earning commissions without navigating the complexities of building an agency alone.

### **Step 3: Set Up Your Home Business**

Treat your new venture like a professional business from the start. You’ll need to:

* Choose a business name
* Open a business bank account
* Create a simple website or landing page
* Designate a small, organized workspace

Laying this foundation will give your business structure, credibility, and room to grow.

### **Step 4: Gain Access to Travel Vendors and Training**

Partnering with a host agency gives you instant access to major travel suppliers such as airlines, hotel groups, cruise lines, and tour operators. You’ll also receive vendor-specific training to help you specialize in the types of travel you’re passionate about, such as cruises, theme parks, luxury vacations, or family travel.

One of the best perks of being a travel agent is enjoying discounted travel and exclusive rates for your own trips, making it possible to explore more while building your business.

### **Step 5: Market Your Services**

Marketing is how you build trust and attract clients. You don’t need to be a marketing expert, but you do need consistency. Here are effective ways to start:

* Share travel tips and insights on social media
* Create destination guides or themed Pinterest boards
* Build an email list to share offers and updates
* Produce short videos or live sessions to showcase your expertise

Position yourself as a trusted advisor. People book with people they trust, not just websites.

### **Step 6: Build Your Network and Grow Your Income**

Your success as a travel agent depends on the relationships you build—with clients, industry partners, and fellow agents. Network within travel communities, stay up to date through supplier trainings, encourage referrals, and consider mentoring others once you’re established.

The more you grow your knowledge and connections, the more opportunities you create for additional income streams, whether through individual bookings, group travel, or building a team.

### **Why Now Is the Perfect Time**

The travel industry has seen tremendous growth and demand for personal travel advisors continues to rise. People want trusted guidance, not just another online booking engine. Becoming a home-based agent today gives you the flexibility to set your schedule, travel more for less, and build meaningful income doing something you love.
