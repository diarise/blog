Thailand’s floating markets are a cultural treasure, offering a unique window into local life. Wooden boats, piled high with fruits, spices, and handmade goods, drift along the waterways while vendors call out to visitors.  

The most famous is **Damnoen Saduak**, located about 100 km from Bangkok. It’s a feast not just for the taste buds, but for the eyes and soul.  

Tip: Go early in the morning to avoid the crowds and capture the best photos.
