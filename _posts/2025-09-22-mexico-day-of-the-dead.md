Every year, from **October 31st to November 2nd**, Mexico celebrates Día de los Muertos — the Day of the Dead. Families build **ofrendas** (altars) decorated with marigolds, candles, and photos of loved ones, while the streets fill with music, dancing, and parades.  

The belief is that spirits return to visit, enjoying the offerings of food and drink. It’s a reminder that death is not an end, but a continuation of connection.  

UNESCO recognizes it as an **Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity**, and for good reason — it’s one of the most powerful cultural expressions in the world.
